The First Byte
==============

## Why Byte Yagami?
#### Choosing the identity
Well I consider my self a purist when needed and a pragmatist when things need to be done. I wanted the name to be funny at the sametime imply seriousness in the craft.
#### Half pun and Half Inspiration
* Light Yagami - Character Inspiration from [Death Note](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0877057/){:target="_blank"}
* Byte ~ Light - Thats the pun. Should I need to explain ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯


## Why did I chose this identity? What do I want from it?

Excerpt from the book The Software Craftsman (cited in the comments) in [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/f2rplr/why_are_we_so_bad_at_software_engineering/):
> It is our responsibility, as professionals, to do best for our client, even if that is not what they initially want (same as doctors and lawyers do)

I beleive software can be done better, should be done better for the betterment of ourselves and those who rely on us.
