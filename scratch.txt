# How did I set my cloudfront

make travis upload to s3
use cloudfront to s3
	- Create two origins
		1. for s3 html objects
		2. For s3 assets directory
	- create two behaviours
		1. for normal html pages - cache for 1 hour
		2. for assets - cache for 1 day

Still cache control is not set
Go to s3:
	1. Select assets folder -> more -> add metadata -> set key -> Cache-Control: 86400
	2. Select 404 and license -> Cache for oneyear


I missed a point... cloudfrot needs <domain.com>/work.html and not <domain.com>/work
So will resort to serving assets via cloudfront and use github pages.
But github pages can only use master branch to serve. 
So use travis to build _site -> upload _site to master branch, upload assets to s3 and use cloudfront there.
