## Why Byte Yagami?
#### Choosing the identity
Well I consider my self a purist when needed and a pragmatist when things need to be done. I wanted the name to be funny at the sametime imply seriousness in the craft.
#### Half pun and Half Inspiration
* Light Yagami - Character Inspiration from [Death Note](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0877057/){:target="_blank"}
* Byte ~ Light - A rhyme to tie to computer sciences
