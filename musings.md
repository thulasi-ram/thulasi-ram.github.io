## Why Byte Yagami?

Well I consider my self a purist when needed and a pragmatist when things need to be done. There is no word to describe this split personality.
#### Half pun and Half Inspiration
* Light Yagami - Character Inspiration from [Death Note](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0877057/){:target="_blank"}
* Byte ~ Light - A rhyme to tie to computer sciences
