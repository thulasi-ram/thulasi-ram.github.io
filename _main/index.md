My objective is to change for better the quality of life of the people through the products I design and lead. I come with a hybrid background in both backend and frontend systems and exceptional experience working in fast-paced, deadline-oriented environments.  　
* Comfortable with Python and its most popular frameworks (Django, Flask etc) and SQL (mostly postgres and little bit of DB2)
* Can dabble with Javascript, Java and css frameworks like Boostrap, Semantic and Foundation
* Occasionally experimented with languages like Haskell, Clojure, Go and Elixir (Toy projects)


Professionally 5+ years of hands-on experience and exposure to both file based and messaging systems (Rabbitmq, Redis, SQS). Also well versed with Ops tools like Docker, Jenkins, AWS and UML.
