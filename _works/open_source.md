## Feature Toggle, PyPi
_September 2017_  
A python package which can be hooked onto Django as an app. The app is based on behavioural design pattern “Feature toggle” by Martin Fowler. Extensive customizability and inherently modular design choices were the focus in this project. First hand experience in packaging a project, hosting github pages (“gh pages”) with “read the docs” and “Sphinx”.

## Diff and Patch, PyPi
_August 2018_  
A simple python package which serves as a framework for diffing and patching complex objects. Inspired by git diff and patch.

## Ivory 
_March 2018 - stalled_  
A CRM that supports GST. Draws inspirations from git. Provides clear hierarchy to avoid duplicated data entries. 

## Logistika 
_February 2017 - discontinued_  
A django project aimed at building modular order management system which can also serve as Vendor portal. Features full user registration/Login, Audit log, Access control and Vendor Discovery. This project also served as a  means to refresh my frontend skills as well.

## Argos  
_December 2017 - conceptualized_  
The aim of argos is to categorize and provide semantic search on images in our photo galleries. This is done by extracting text out of images partly on the device and partly on cloud and processing it.
